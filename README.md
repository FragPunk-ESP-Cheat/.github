## 🔎 What Is the ESP Cheat in FragPunk?

ESP (Extra Sensory Perception) is a **visual overlay cheat** that shows you player models, objects, loot, and more — even if they’re behind walls, above you, or halfway across the map.

It doesn’t aim for you, but it **removes all the guesswork**, giving you **the same info the game hides** from regular players. Pair it with soft aim or triggerbot for a deadly legit-style combo 🔫
